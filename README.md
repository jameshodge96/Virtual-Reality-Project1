I liked the scripts that we got to play around with as it was fantastic to see the potential we can do with Unity and VR. The one thing I disliked is that I didn\'92t know what to do with the scripts. I\'92d like to have known a bit more about them and potentially few videos saying you can change this or this and even make our own scripts.\
